# ownCloud Documentation Themes

:blue_book: This repository stores the themes for the ownCloud documentation.

The repository contains three directories: _static_, _templates_, and _themes_.
Templates is currently empty.
Static contains some of the broader static files, perhaps not specific to the documentation, but more to ownCloud itself.
Themes contains four theme directories:

- **bootstrap:** This is the base theme which all sphinx-doc themes are built on top of
- **owncloud_com:** This is the theme that matches [owncloud.com](https://www.owncloud.com)
- **owncloud_org:** This is the theme that matches [owncloud.org](https://www.owncloud.org)
- **ownCloud_release**

This repository can be linked into any other documentation repository that requires it.
To do so, add it as [a Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
